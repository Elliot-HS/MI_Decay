MI_Decay acts as a master folder containing both trial data and custom codes used for MI Decay Analyses - Associated with the manuscript: Howard-Spink et al. (2022) "Syntactic complexity of chimpanzee action in a natural tool-use task".

To run the code, please download a version of RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/) (This code was written in RStudio Version 1.2.5001). Total installation time ~ 10 minutes.

Codes were written and tested on RStudio (Version 1.2.5001) on operating system macOS Monterey 12.3.1.

To run the code, open RStudio and open file MI_Analysis_Functions.R. Please keep the file MI_Analysis_Functions.R in the same folder as the example dataset (example_data.csv) to ensure you can easily import the data into R. 

MI_Analysis_Functions.R contains descriptions of each function, and contains examples of how the functions should run using the example data example_data.csv. The output for this data should reflect data presented for Fanle in the main manuscript. The relevant packages required to run the code are outlined in the R script, alongside the version of each package used to write the code (last updated April 2022).

For any functions which take substantial periods of time (over 5 minutes) to run, a short warning is provided below the function. Please read all information about each function before running them on the example data.

For any issues, contact Elliot Howard-Spink (co-corresponding author) by email at Elliot.Howard-Spink@zoo.ox.ac.uk.
